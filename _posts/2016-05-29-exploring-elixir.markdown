I recently came across the Elixir programming language while looking for a way to implement an internet of things application. The more I read about it, the more ideal it seemed. Over the next couple of months I am going to try and implement our application in Elixir and document here lessons along the way, so that other beginners one day be helped in getting going in doing any similar sort of applicationâ€¦.and to help me remember what I have learnt!
